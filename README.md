# IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection using ML
This project is a competition from Kaggle posted 3 years ago. (Link to the original problem https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection)

In this project we want to check **whether the transaction is fraud (1) or not (0)?** from given variables. 
We consider this problem is a classification problem --> 0 or 1.
Believed that there are many advanced solutions to predict the fraud transactions under this course we will be focuding on few models to solve this problem: K-mean clustering, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
The following metrics will be taken into consideration for evalutaion our models are: Area Under the ROC Curve (ROC AUC) and Confusion Matrix.
